## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Adventure of The Ronin

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A 2D platformer with some action

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The game will allow the player to move an avator in all directions. The avator will also be able to jump and run. The player will also have in game items. I will be making my game either through Unity or Pygames.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A simple platformer that has a movable object and a functioning code. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A detailed platformer that has cool game sprites and in game items. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A complete platformer with levels, enemies, weather conditions, and bosses. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will be learning a new game engine. I may need to learn c# or more python depending on the engine I choose. I will need to research about how to make a platformer and how to desgin a game that is fun to play.
